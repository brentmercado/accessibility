Demonstrates web accessibility

Roughly 15 percent of the world's population lives with some form of disability, of whom 2 to 4 percent experience significant difficulties in functioning. Disabilities come in many forms such as vision and/or hearing impaired, difficulty with motor functions, and attention spans. The purpose of this web page is to demonstrate web accessibility. Websites should be accessible by everyone, and as web developers, it is our responsibility to build experiences for all. 

This website can be navigated with only a keyboard by using the Tab button to move forward, and Shift + Tab buttons to move backwards. Users can also experience this website using a screen reader. Some popular choices for screen readers are “VoiceOver” for Mac users and “NVDA” for Windows. Color contrast was also taken into account and conforms to WCAG Level AA standards. Users can download the Chrome Extension “NoCoffee” to view the web page from the perspective of a person suffering from vision disabilities.
